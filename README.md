# C sharp Calculator
C# was a whole other piece of work, but i love this language.
Basically, this is from the windows tutorial about C#. I didn't upload all the classes because it's mostly a placeholder for what is more of a journal entry here, I tried to replicate the tutorial as much as i could and tweak it. 
I really like how clear C# is, similar to Java you can really navigate effortlessly between the two as long as you know the "rules"! 

Everyday stepping closer to the dream project!
